            <h2>Why can't I learn more things in this course?</h2>
            <p>For one, this course has been an extremely slow buildup until now where we are finally learning basic HTML which I already know.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it's also because everyone continously asks stupid questions.</p>
            <p>Finally, I am also just smart so I am just better than these idiots in this course.</p>
